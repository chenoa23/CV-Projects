# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of Computer Vision projects I completed as part of my studies at Miami Dade College. Each project demonstrates practical applications of image processing and machine learning techniques, including tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.

## Projects Included
 **Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup** – Developed a Python web scraper using the BeautifulSoup library to extract and parse data from HTML web pages. The project demonstrates how to request web content, handle raw HTML, search and extract specific HTML elements like headings, links, and images, and download media files programmatically. Additionally, it includes interaction with APIs (e.g., YouTube Data API) to retrieve and save video thumbnails. This project highlights skills in data extraction, parsing, and basic automation useful for gathering datasets from the web.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## About Me
I’m currently studying Applied Artificial Intelligence at Miami Dade College, where I’ve completed hands-on projects in Computer Vision, NLP, Machine Learning, and Data Science. This repo highlights my practical experience and growth in the field.
