# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of Computer Vision projects I completed as part of my studies at Miami Dade College. Each project demonstrates practical applications of image processing and machine learning techniques, including tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.

## Projects Included

- **Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup**  
  Developed a Python web scraper using the BeautifulSoup library to extract and parse data from HTML web pages. This project covers requesting web content, parsing HTML elements (headings, links, images), downloading media files programmatically, and interacting with APIs (e.g., YouTube Data API) to retrieve video thumbnails. It highlights skills in data extraction, parsing, and automation for dataset gathering.

- **Building Blocks of CNN**  
  Explored the fundamental components of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras, including convolutional layers, pooling, and activation functions.

- **Gesture Controlled Light Switch**  
  Created a gesture recognition system that controls a light switch using computer vision techniques and Mediapipe hand tracking for real-time interaction.

- **Image Preprocessing Using OpenCV**  
  Implemented image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, filtering, edge detection, and color space transformations to prepare images for further analysis or model input.

- **VGG Neural Network Implementation**  
  Built and trained a VGG-style CNN architecture to perform image classification tasks, showcasing transfer learning and deep network design principles.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebooks & Google Colab  

## About Me
I’m currently studying Applied Artificial Intelligence at Miami Dade College, where I’ve completed hands-on projects in Computer Vision, NLP, Machine Learning, and Data Science. This repo highlights my practical experience and growth in the field.
